It all began in 2024 at **Chapel School**, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Two students, **Duda Duarte** and **Vibha Komala**, embarked on a journey to bring their shared passion for **economics** and **technology** into the spotlight. What started as a **Computer Science class project** soon evolved into a platform aimed at merging these interests in a meaningful way.

The idea stemmed from their desire to create something that could bring value to others while allowing them to explore the intersection of **technology** and **economics**â€”a field they both find incredibly fascinating. With this project, they hope to not only excel in their class but also inspire other students to pursue their passions, be it in tech, business, or beyond.
